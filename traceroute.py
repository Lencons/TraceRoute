"""Routines for network route mapping and latency testing.

The implementation of routines for utilising ICMP network packets to
investigate packet routing within an IP network. A network "ping" is
performed by sending a UDP data packet to an uninitialised port on the
destination server and catching the ICMP that is returned. The time
delta between the sending of the UDP packet and recieving the ICMP
packet is the latency measured between the source and destination.

The "hops" that a packet takes as it transverses across the network
on its way to the destination host can be mapped through the restricing
the Time To Live (TTL) as uesd by the traceroute command. Through performing
several pings starting with a TTL of 1 and incrementing the TTL until the
destination host is reached, each network router will return a ICMP timeout
response as it received the expired UDP packet. Recording the source of each
ICMP packet identifies the routing points of packets to the destination.

    """Perform a network 'Ping' to a remote host collecting latency data.
    
    Using the provided endpoint hostname or address, a standard network ping
    is performed with latency data collected and returned for each packet
    sent.

    The "ping" action is performed by opening a RAW ICMP socket to listen for
    router responses then on a second UDP socket sending a packet of data to
    an unused UDP port and waiting for the ICMP response.

    Note
    ----
        This function sends UDP packets and then captures the returned ICMP
        packets. The opening of a RAW socket to captuer the returned ICMP
        packet is a privledged task which cannot be performed from userspace.

        THIS FUNCTION CAN ONLY BE USED BY PRIVLEDGED USERS (root/Administrator)

    Parameters
    ----------
    endpoint
        Target network address or hostname to route the UDP packets too
    port
        Port to assign to the UDP packets, standard is 33434
